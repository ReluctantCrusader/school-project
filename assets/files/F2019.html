Avid bookworm and college student Motosu Urano ends up dying in an unforeseen accident. This came right after the news that she would finally be able to work 
as a librarian like she had always dreamed of.<br><br>
When she regained consciousness, she was reborn as Myne, the daughter of a poor soldier. She was in the town of Ehrenfest, a town that existed in a parallel 
world and had a harsh class system where the magic-wielding nobles ruled supreme. But Myne doesn't really let that get to her. After all, as long as she had 
books, she didn't really need anything else.<br><br>
However, this world had a very low literacy rate and no real way of printing books, so books were scarce and belonged only to the nobles. They were completely 
out of reach for the daughter of some poor soldier. But that doesn't stop Myne from wanting to read books, so she makes a decision...
"If there aren't any books, I'll just create some."<br><br>
Myne might not have energy or money, but she has an endless amount of knowledge from all the books she read in her previous life. Will Myne actually be able 
to make some books? Myne's adventure to create books starts now.</div>

<div class="synopsis">Question: What would you do if a girl you liked asked you out on a date?<br><br>
Now imagine it’s not one, but two beautiful girls, the cool beauty, Cosmos, and the cute childhood friend, Himawari!! Of course, you would make plans with 
both, right, and feel like a total stud. Except for the “feelings” they confess to you are…<br><br>
Asking me for “romantic advice,” since they’re both in love with someone else. Hahaha…<br><br>
That’s it! I’m not gonna take it anymore! I’m giving up on this obtuse, harmless persona and going back to my true self. But I can’t give up hope here. If I give 
them my advice, at least one of them may fall in love with me!<br><br>
But a girl on the sidelines witnessed my sad, solitary battle. She’s Sumireko Sanshokuin (Pansy), a gloomy, glasses-wearing girl with braids.<br>
I hate her, to be honest. And yet… she’s the only one who loves me?!<br><br>
And so it begins the slightly stimulating teen coming-of-age romantic(?) comedy about a protagonist who doesn’t realize he’s a background character and the 
quirky, magnificent girls orbiting him!</div>
